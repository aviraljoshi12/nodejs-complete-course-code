NPX and NPM are just a js file

What npx does?
Searches for a file and executes it

Step 1:
  Searches for package.json in current working directory
  Searches for name key in the json
  Searches for bin (binary) key

  In package.json the code is:
  {
  "name": "hello",
  "bin": "app.js"
}

Code in app.js:
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("hii");

So if I do npx hello, I will get in terminal:
hii

Step 2:
    Searches for hello named file in .bin folder in node_modules in current working directory
    And executes this file
    Inside /node_modules/.bin/hello

    I have written this code:
    echo 'hii I am hello'

So if I now do npx hello, and comment code in package.json, I will see in terminal:
hii I am hello

OR

#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log('I am hello')

It will give same output

Step 3:
   Searches for hello file in global npm installed folders

   So we can run this command first to check where our global packages are stored:
   npm root -g
   It will give a path, on clicking the path we can see all our global packages

   So if I do 
   npm i hello -g

   In my directory where there were global packages: I can see a global package name as hello

Step 4:
   Searches for hello package in npx cache

Step 5:
   Searches for hello package in npm registry
   Gives prompts to install the package if found
   Downloads and installs
